    <p>The orange circle is moving along the track, with a rope attached to it. The rope is tied to the gray pole. At this instant in time, the velocity of the circle is $\mathbf{v}_o = {{params.v}}$ m/s.</p>
<p> Compute the rate at which the angle between the rope and the horizontal is changing at this instant in time. </p>
<p>Let radius of curvature be length $\mathbf{r} = {{params.r}}$ m and let $\mathbf{\theta} = {{params.theta}}^o$.</p>
