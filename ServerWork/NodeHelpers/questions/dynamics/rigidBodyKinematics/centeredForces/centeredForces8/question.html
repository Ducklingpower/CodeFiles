<p>  The fly-wheel has a mass of $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}}~kg$ and has a radius of gyration about the pin of $\mathbf{k} = {{params.k}}~m$</p>
<p> The radius of the flywheel is $\mathbf{r} = {{params.r}}~m$. The cord wrapped around the wheel supports the mass $\mathbf{m_a} = {{params.ma}}~kg$.</p>
<p>Determine the angular acceleration of the flywheel if block (A) were to be released from rest.</p>
