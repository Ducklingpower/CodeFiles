    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text"> To find the velocity of point B, we have to use this equation of motion: $v = v_o + \omega $ x $ r + v_{rel}$. Using this equation we can plug in what is given and solve for the velocity.</pl-hint>




    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
   <p>Solving for the velocity using the equation: $v_b = v_o + \omega $ x $ r + v_{rel}$.</p>
<p>For this question its easier to put our axis along the rod as shown in the image. We can also calculate the total  from point A to point B to be: $L = 2rcvos(\theta)$</p>
<p>It's also important to note that the angle of the velocity vector to the rod can be calculated as : $\phi = 90 - \theta$</p>


   <li>$v_b = 0 + \omega $ x $ [L\hat{i}+ 0\hat{j}]+ -v \hat{i} $ $\implies$ $v_b =- v_r \hat{i}+ \omega L \hat{j}  $</li>


breaking up the equation into its x and y components we can solve for the velocity.
<li>y: $v_bsin(\phi) = wL~ \implies ~ v = \frac{wL}{sin(\phi)}$ = {{correct_answers.velocity}} $m/s$</li>
<li>x: $-vcos(\phi) = -v_r ~\implies~ v_r = (\frac{wL}{sin(\phi)}) cos(\phi)$. We will need the relative velocity for solving the acceleration.</li>






   <p>We can now solve for the acceleration. It is the same approach just with a different equation.</p>

        <p>To solve for the acceleration we can use the equation: $A_b = A_o + \alpha $ x $ r-\omega^2r+2\omega$ x $ v_{rel} + A_{rel}$</p>
        <li>$A_b = 0 + 0 $x $[L \hat{i}+ 0\hat{j}]-\omega^2[L\hat{i}] + 2\omega$ x $ [V_r + 0\hat{j}] - A_r \hat{i} $</li>
        <p>re-organizing and taking some cross products</p>
        <li>$A_b = [-\omega^2L-A_r ] \hat{i} + [2\omega v_r]\hat{j}$</li>
          <p>Now we can break up the acceleration into its x and y components to solve for the magnitude.</p>


        <li>y: $A_b sin(\phi) = 2\omega v_r ~\implies~ \frac{2\omega v_r}{sin(\phi)} ~\implies ~ \frac{2\omega \omega L cos(\phi)}{sin(\phi) sin(\phi)}$ = ${{correct_answers.accel}} m/s^2$  </li>
        </ul>
