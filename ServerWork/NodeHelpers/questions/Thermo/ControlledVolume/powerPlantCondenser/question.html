    <p>Steam enters the condenser of a vapor power plant at a pressure of $\mathbf{P_1} = {{params.P1}}~bar$ with a quality of $\mathbf{x_1} = {{params.x1}}$ and exits at a pressure of $\mathbf{P_2} = {{params.P2}}~bar$ and a temperature of $\mathbf{T_2} = {{params.T2}}~^\circ C$. Cooling water enters the condenser in a separate stream as a liquid at a temperature of $\mathbf{T_3} = {{params.T3}}~^\circ C$ and exits as a liquid at $\mathbf{T_4} = {{params.T4}}~^\circ C$, with no change in pressure.</p>
    <p>Assume that heat transfer from the outside of the condenser and changes in the kinetic and potential energies of the flowing streams can be ignored. For steady-state operation, determine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) The ratio of the mass flow rate of the cooling water to the mass flow rate of the condensing stream.</li>
        <li>(b) The rate of energy transfer from the condensing steam to the cooling water, in $\mathbf{kJ/kg}$ of steam passing through the condenser.</li>
    </ul>
