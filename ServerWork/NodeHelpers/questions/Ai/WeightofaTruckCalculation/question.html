  A truck of unknown weight is traveling at {{params.speed}} {{params.unitsSpeed}}. The driver hits the brakes to bring the truck to a halt in {{params.distance}} {{params.unitsDistance}}. If there are {{params.numTires}} tires on the truck, and each has a brake drum of {{params.diameter}} {{params.unitsDiameter}} and weighs {{params.weight}} {{params.unitsWeight}}, and the temperature increase in each brake due to the braking is {{params.tempIncrease}} {{params.unitsTemperature}}. Assume that all brakes are equally applied. The specific heat of the material of the brake is {{params.specificHeat}} {{params.unitsSpecificHeat}}. Assume that there is no heat transfer from the brakes to the outside during the braking.
