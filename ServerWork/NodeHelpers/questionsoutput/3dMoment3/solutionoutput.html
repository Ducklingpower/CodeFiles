        You can find the direction of the vectors by identifying two points along the line of action of each vector.
        Lable the point where the two forces are coming out of (C). And lable the ends of the ropes that are on the ground points R and G. R for the red force and G for the green force. 
        Now to find the direction you can do R-C and G-C</p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
                <ul> 
                    finding direction of green and red force vectors.
                <li> Red vector: R-C = \( (L_2,-L_3,0) - (0,0,L_1) \) = \( (L_2,-L_3,-L_1) \) </li>
                <li> Green vector: G-C =  \(  (0,L_3,0) - (0,0,L_1) \) = \( (0,L_3,-L_1)  \)</li>
                    Now that we have the direction of both of the vectors we can find the unit vectors by dividing the lengths of the vectors by its self.
                <li> Unit vector R:  \( \vec{U}_R   \) = \( \frac{(L_2,-L_3,-L_1) }{\sqrt{(L_2)^2+(L_3)^2+(L_1)^2}} \)</li>
                <li> Unit vector G:  \( \vec{U}_G   \) = \( \frac{(0,L_3,-L_1)}{\sqrt{(L_3)^2+ (L_1)^2}} \)</li>
                   Now that we have the unit vectors we can finally find the force vectors \( \vec{F}_R \) and \( \vec{F}_G \)
                <li> \( \vec{F}_R \) = \( (\mathbf{F}_R)(\vec{U}_R ) \) = \( (\mathbf{F}_R) \frac{(L_2,-L_3,-L_1) }{\sqrt{(L_2)^2+(L_3)^2+(L_1)^2}} \)</li>
                <li> \( \vec{F}_G \) = \( (\mathbf{F}_G)(\vec{U}_G ) \) = \( (\mathbf{F}_G) \frac{(0,L_3,-L_1)}{\sqrt{(L_3)^2+ (L_1)^2}} \)</li>
                </ul>
            </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p> 
        <ul>
           <li>It is important to note that when computing the moment about o we chose a vector that starts at o and ends somewhere along the line of action 
           of the force vectors. In our case the vector that starts at o and ends along the line of action of the force vectors is \( \vec{d} = 0\hat{i}+0\hat{j}+L_1\hat{k} \)</li>
           <li>\( M_o = M_R + M_G \) = \(  [\vec{d} X \vec{F}_R] + [\vec{d} X \vec{F}_G]  \)</li>
          
          
        </ul>
