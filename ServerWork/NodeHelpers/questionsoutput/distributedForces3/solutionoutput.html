        <ul>
            <li> To find the magnitude of the forces compute the area of the triangular shape by using the height: \(  F_D  \) and \(  P_D  \) and lengths: \(  L_1  \) and \(  L_2  \) </li>
            <li> Concentrated force \(  F = (79)(15)/2 \) and concentrated force \(  P = (138)(10)/2  \).</li>
            <li> To find the location of the concentrated forces you must find the centroid of the distributed forces and compute there distances from point A. 
                Since both of the distributed forces are triangular shaped we know the centroid of a triangle is 1/3 the base with an orgin at the right angle.</li>
            <li> Position of concentrated forces relative to point A: \(  F_x = (15)(2/3)  \) and \( P_x = (10)(1/3) + 15 \)</li>
            <li> With the the two concentrated forces and the positions, you can now calculate the moment about point A. </li>
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        <ul>
            <li> To calculate the moment about point A we must multiply the forces acting on the beam by the distances it is from point A.</li>
            <li> Moment about point A = -(F)(\( F_x \))+(P)(\( P_x \)), Which will come out to \( 6725\ Nm \) </li>
        </ul>
