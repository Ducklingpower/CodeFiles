      </head><h2> Level 0 </h2><p>First you want to compute the reaction forces at A and B. The first step in doing so is to convert the distributed load into one force concentrated at its centroid.
        <p>We can compute the magnitde of the net force of the distributed force to be \( F(L) \). The centroid is simply \( \frac{L}{2} \)</p>
        <p>Now that you have the magniude of the force and the location, you can compute the reaction forces.</p>

    </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
                In order to compute the reation forces you have to set up your equilibrium equations. 
                <li>\( \Sigma{F}_y = A_y+B_y-F(L) = 0 \)</li>
                <li>\( \Sigma{M}_A = B_y (L) - F(L)(\frac{L}{2}) =0 \)</li>
                <p>Solving for the reaction forces we get: </p>
                <li>\( B_y = \frac{F(L)}{2} = 15.75 ~kN \)</li>
                <li>\( A_y = F(L)-B_y =  15.75 ~kN  \)</li>
         <p>With all of the forces acting on the beam you can draw the shear force and moment diagram. You can use the moment diagram to find your max moment.</p>


    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        <ul> 
          The max moment is the area under shear force curve of the positive half.
          <li>Max moment = \( \frac{A_y(\frac{L}{2})}{2} =  23.625 \) kN*m</li>

          <p>Moving on to finding the moment of inertia: I = \( \Sigma(\bar{I}+Ad^2) \)</p>
          Where \( \bar{I} = \frac{1}{12}b(h^3)  \) and d = distance from sub shape centroid to centrial axis.

        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p> 
        <ul>
          
        <p>Solving for Inertia:</p>
        <li> \( \bar{I}+Ad^2 \) for the bottem and top rectangle: \( 2[\frac{1}{12}(L_2)(L_3)^3 + (L_2)(L_3)(\frac{L_1}{2}+\frac{L_3}{2})^2] \) </li>
        We can just compute \( \bar{I}+Ad^2 \) as if we are only doing it for the top rectangle, then multiply it by 2 since the top and bottem rectangle are geometricly the same. 
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>\( \bar{I}+Ad^2 \) for the middle rectangle : \( [\frac{1}{12}(L_3)(L_1)^3] \)</li>
        We dont need to compute \( Ad^2 \) for the center rectangle since the centreoid of the center rectangle = central axis, so the distance between centreoid of the center rectangle and the central axis will be d = 0
        <p>We can now add up the moment of inertia of the sub shapes to get:</p>
        <li>I = \( \Sigma(\bar{I}+Ad^2) \) = \( 2[\frac{1}{12}(L_2)(L_3)^3 + (L_2)(L_3)(\frac{L_1}{2}+\frac{L_3}{2})^2] \) +  \( [\frac{1}{12}(L_3)(L_1)^3] =  317.035026 ~ \mu m^4 \)</li>
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p> 
        <ul>
                Lastly you can compute the Max bending stress as :\(  \frac{M ~C}{I} \), where C is the distance you want to calculate the bending stress.
                <p>In our case C is the distance form center to the edge, so that will be \( \frac{L_1}{2}+L_3 \) </p>
                <li>\( \sigma_{max} = \frac{M ~C}{I} = 12.742677208164373 \) Mpa</li>
