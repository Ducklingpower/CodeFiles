Beam AD,BF,CE, and pully F, and right the X and Y reaction forces acting at each point on all 4 parts.  </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        <ul>
        Solving reaction forces:
        <li>\(  \Sigma F_x = 0, \implies A_x + D_x = 0, \implies A_x = -D_x \)</li>
        <li>\(  \Sigma F_y = 0, \implies A_y - W = 0, \implies A_y = W, \implies A_y = 387 lb \)</li>
        <li>\(  \Sigma M_A = 0, \implies (D_x)(L_1+L_2+L_3+L_4) - (W)(L_1+L_2+r) = 0. \) Solving for \( D_x = (W)(L_1+L_2+r) / (L_1+L_2+L_3+L_4) = 306.02597402597405 \) \( lb \)</li>
        </ul>

        Reminder: If 2 parts share 1 point then the reactions on each parts must be equal oppisite to each other.

            <li> Now that everything is set up you can now start solving each part by doing \(  \Sigma F_x = 0  \), \(  \Sigma F_y = 0  \) and \(  \Sigma M_A = 0.  \)</li>

        Solving reaction forces:
        <li> Beam BF: \(  \Sigma M_B = 0 \implies -(E_y)(L_2) - (W)(L_2+L_3+r)=0 \implies |E_y| = (W)(L_2+L_3+r)/-l_2 = 306.02597402597405 \) \( lb \)</li>
        -
        <li> Beam CE: tan(\( \theta \)) = (opp/adj) \( \implies \) tan(\( \theta \)) =\(  (L_1/L_2) \implies \theta =  \)atan\( (L_1/L_2) \)
        </li><li> Now we can solve for \( E_x \): tan(\( \theta \)) = \(  E_y/E_x \implies |E_x| = E_y / \) tan(\( \theta \)) = \( 591.9532710280374 \) \( lb \) </li>
        <li> By \(  \Sigma F_x = 0  \), \(  \Sigma F_y = 0  \) we can come to the conclusion that \( C_x = E_x \) and \( C_y = E_y \)</li>
        -
        <li> Pully F: \(  \Sigma F_x = 0  \), \(  \Sigma F_y = 0  \) we can come to the conclusion that \( F_y = W  \) and \(  F_x = W  \)</li>
        -
        <li>Beam BF: Now that we have \( F_x,F_y,E_x,E_y \) we can solve for the reactions at point B.</li>
        <li>\(  \Sigma F_x = 0  \), \(  \Sigma F_y = 0 \implies B_x = E_x - F_x, \) and \(  B_y = E_y - F_y \)</li>
        <li>\( B_x = 796.9065420560748 \) lb</li>
        <li>\( B_y = 204.95327102803742 \) lb</li>

        <li>Note: The solutions want the magnitude of the forces which is why they all come out positve.</li>
        <li>When you get negative solutions for reaction forces, that indactes that you have to switch the force direction.</li>
        <li>For example: This is why when solving for \( B_x \) it NOT \( B_x = E_x + F_x \) even though that is technically correct with the way we initially drew the forces.</li>
        <li>It is beacuse the true direction of \( E_x \) on beam BF is to the right (positive x direction) regardless of the direction of our initial guess. </li>
