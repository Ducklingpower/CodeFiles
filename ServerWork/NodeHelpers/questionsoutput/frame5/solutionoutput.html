        Since member AB is a two force member we can draw the reaction force at point B as a single force point towards B and at an angle that follows a line from point A to B. 
        Lastly you can draw the tension forces causes by the pully and the weight. The tension points left and down coming from the pully.  </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
                <ul>
                    Solving using member CB:


                    <p>Let \( \theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{2_1}{L_2})  \)</p>

                    <li>\( \Sigma{M}_C = 0  \) \( \implies \) \( B_rSin(\theta)L_2+ W(R) - W (L_2+L_3+R) = 0 \)</li>
                    <p> Solving for \( B_R \) (the reaction force on point B) we get:</p>
                    <li>\( B_R = \frac{W(L_2+L_3+R)-W(R)}{Sin(\theta)L_2} \)</li>
                    


                    We can break the reaction force \( B_R \) into \( B_x \) and \( B_y \):
                    <li>\( B_x = cos(\theta)B_R \) </li>
                    <li>\( B_y = sin(\theta)B_R \) </li>

                    Now you can try to solve for \( C_x \) and \( C_y \)

                </ul>
            </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p> 
        <ul>
            Solving for \( C_x \) and \( C_y \):
            <li>\( \Sigma{F}_x = 0  \) \( \implies \) \(  B_x - C_x -W = 0 \) \( \implies \) \( C_x = W-B_x \) </li>
            <li>\( \Sigma{F}_y = 0  \) \( \implies \) \(  B_y - C_y -W = 0 \) \( \implies \) \( C_y = W-B_y \) </li>

            Solutions:
           \(  B_x = 729.5555555555557 lb \)
           \(  B_y = 547.1666666666667 lb \)
           \(  C_x = 260.55555555555566 lb \)
           \(  C_y = 78.16666666666674 lb \)
             
             
        
        
        </ul>
