    A truck weighing 17693 lbs is traveling at an unknown speed. The driver hits the brakes to bring the truck to a halt in 355 ft. If there are 18 tires on the truck, and each has a brake drum of 31 in and weighs 30 lbs, and the temperature increase in each brake due to the braking is 105 F. Assume that all brakes are equally applied. The specific heat of the material of the brake is 0.107 BTU/(lb*F). Assume that there is no heat transfer from the brakes to the outside during the braking. Determine the initial speed of the truck.
