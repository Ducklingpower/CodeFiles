      </head><h2> Level 0 </h2><p>To determine the initial speed of the truck, we first need to calculate the total energy absorbed by the brakes during the braking process.</p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>The energy absorbed by each brake can be calculated using the formula: \( E = 30 \cdot {params.specificHeat} \cdot 105 \), where \( 30 \) is the mass of the brake in lbs, \( 0.107 \) is the specific heat of the brake material in BTU/(lb*F), and \( 105 \) is the temperature increase in F.</p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>The total energy absorbed by all brakes is the sum of the energy absorbed by each brake: \( E_{total} = E \cdot 18 \).</p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>This total energy absorbed by the brakes is equal to the kinetic energy lost by the truck due to braking: \( E_{total} = \frac{1}{2} 17693 v^2 \), where \( 17693 \) is the mass of the truck in lbs and \( v \) is the initial speed of the truck.</p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>Rearrange the equation to solve for the initial speed of the truck: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{total} }{ 17693 } } \).</p><h2> Level 5 </h2><p>Plug in all known values to calculate the initial speed of the truck. Remember to convert units where necessary to maintain consistency.</p><h2> Level 6 </h2><p>The initial speed of the truck is calculated to be 23.69851481967466 ft/s.</p></html>
