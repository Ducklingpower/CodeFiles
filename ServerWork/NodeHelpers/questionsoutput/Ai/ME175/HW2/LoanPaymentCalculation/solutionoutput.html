        To determine the annual payment for the loan, we can use the formula for the annuity payment, which is given by:
    </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
        \[ PMT = \frac{P \times r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n} } \]
        where:

         <p>PMT is the annual payment</p>
         <p>P is the principal loan amount (\( 45150 \) USD)</p>
            <p>r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)</p>
            <p>n is the total number of payments (years)</p>

    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        First, we need to convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:
        \[ r = \frac{ 3 } {100} \]
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        Next, substitute the values into the annuity payment formula:
        \[ PMT = \frac{ { 45150 \times \left(\frac{ 3 } {100}\right)} } {1 - \left(1 + \frac{ 3 } {100}\right)^{-8 } } \]
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>
        This formula allows us to calculate the annual payment required to pay off the loan over the specified number of years. The final annual payment will be approximately \( 6431.906 \) USD.
