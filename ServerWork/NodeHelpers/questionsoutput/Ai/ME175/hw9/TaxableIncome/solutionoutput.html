        To calculate the taxable income for ACME Inc., we start with the Before-Tax-and-Loan Cash Flow and deduct the payments made on loan principal, loan interest, and the MACRS depreciation deduction.
    </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
        The formula for taxable income can be expressed as:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = \text{Before-Tax-and-Loan Cash Flow} - \text{Loan Interest Payment} - \text{MACRS Depreciation Deduction}
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        Substituting the known values:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = 9681 - 272.1 - 4298
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        The final taxable income for ACME Inc. is thus calculated as follows:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = 9681 - 272.1 - 4298 = 5110.9
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>

        <p>The tax payed is the taxable income multiplied by the tax rate.</p>
        <p>Tax Payed = 5110.9 \( \times \) 17%= 868.85</p>
       
    </p><h2> Level 5 </h2><p>

        The after tax cash flow (ATCF) can be found as: ATCF =  BTLCF - Tax Payed - Expenses

    <p>In our case the expenses is just the principle payed.</p>
    <p>AFTC = 9681 - 868.85 - 1814 = 6998.15</p>
