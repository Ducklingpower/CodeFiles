        To calculate the depreciation expense and the book value of the tape-drive system using the MACRS method, we first need to understand the depreciation rates associated with the property class.
    </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
        The MACRS depreciation method allows for accelerated depreciation, which means that more depreciation expense is recognized in the early years of the asset's life. The property class determines the applicable depreciation rates.
    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        For a 7-year property, the MACRS rates can be found in the IRS guidelines. Typically, the rates for a 7-year property are approximately: 14.29%, 24.49%, 17.49%, 12.49%, 8.93%, 8.92%, 8.93%, and 4.46%.
