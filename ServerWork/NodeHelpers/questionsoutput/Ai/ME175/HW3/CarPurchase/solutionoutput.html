        To calculate the monthly loan payment, we will use the formula for the monthly payment of an amortizing loan:
    </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
        The formula is given by: 
        \[
        A = P \frac{i(1 + i)^n} {(1 + i)^n - 1}
        \]
        where:
       
             <li> A is the total monthly payment</li>
             <li> P is the loan principal (the amount borrowed)</li>
             <li> i is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)</li>
             <li> n is the number of payments (loan term in months)</li>
     
    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        The loan principal can be calculated as:
        \[
        P = \text{ (purchasePrice) } - \text{ (downPayment) } = 30017~ USD - 18175~ USD
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        The monthly interest rate is:
        \[
        i = \frac{ {\text{ (interestRate) } } }{100 \cdot 12}  = \frac{ 8 }{100 \cdot 12}
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>
        The number of payments is simply:
        \[
        n = \text{ (loanTerm) } \times 12 = 69 \times 12
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 5 </h2><p>
        Substituting these values into the monthly payment formula will yield the monthly loan payment:
        \[
        M = ( 30017 - 18175) \frac{ ( \frac{ 8 }{100 \cdot 12}  ) ( 1 + ( \frac{ 8 }{100 \cdot 12}  ) )^{( 69 \times 12)} }{( 1 + ( \frac{ 8 }{100 \cdot 12}  ) )^{( 69 \times 12)} - 1}
        \]
    </p><h2> Level 6 </h2><p>
        Finally, calculating this will give the monthly loan payment as:  214.674 USD.
    </p><h2> Level 7 </h2><p>
     <p> To found how much they where trying to over charge per mont we can find the differnec between the proposed monthly payment and the actual monthly payment.  </p>

     <p>Over chareg = 454.7 - 214.674  = $239.99999999999997 </p>
