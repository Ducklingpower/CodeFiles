    <p> Washington Mill Works is considering the purchase of a large resawing band saw for 15000 USD . The saw is expected to have a useful life of 7 years, after which it will have an estimated salvage value of $5000 USD. Each year, the annual income is estimated to be 9752 USD, while the annual operating expenses are 1779 USD. Assuming a minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) of 5%, calculate the equivalent present worth of the cash flows over the seven-year period.</p>
