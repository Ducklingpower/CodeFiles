    <p> A truck weighing 2689 lb is traveling at 62 mph. The driver hits the brakes to bring the truck to a halt in 300 feet. If there are 34 tires on the truck, and each has a brake drum of 16.5 inches diameter and weighs 131 lb, determine the temperature increase in each brake due to the braking? Assume that all brakes are equally applied. The specific heat of the material of the brake is 0.12 BTU/(lb*Â°F). Assume that there is no heat transfer from the brakes to the outside during the braking.</p>
