The truck weighs 2689 lb, is traveling at 62 mph, and must stop within 300 feet. The truck has 34 tires, each with a brake drum of 16.5 inches in diameter and weighing 131 lb. The specific heat of the brake material is 0.12 BTU/(lb*°F), and it is assumed that there is no heat transfer from the brakes to the outside during braking.</p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>Known Variables Description:
    <ul>
        <li>Weight of the truck (W): 2689 lb</li>
        <li>Initial velocity (v_i): 62 mph (converted to feet per second for calculations)</li>
        <li>Number of tires (n_tires): 34</li>
        <li>Weight of each brake drum (m): 131 lb</li>
        <li>Specific heat of brake material (c): 0.12 BTU/(lb*°F)</li>
    </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>Equation Setup:
    <ol>
        <li>Kinetic energy (KE) of the truck is converted to thermal energy (Q) in the brakes:
        \(KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2\)
        \(Q = KE\) (since energy is conserved and all kinetic energy is assumed to be converted to heat)</li>
        <li>The thermal energy absorbed by each brake drum is:
        \(Q_{\text{per brake} } = \frac{Q}{n_{\text{tires} } }\)</li>
        <li>The temperature change (\(\Delta T\)) in each brake drum is given by:
        \(Q = m c \Delta T\)</li>
    </ol>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>Solution Process:
    <ol>
        <li>Convert the truck's initial velocity from mph to ft/s:
        \(v_i = 62 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft} }{1 \, \text{mile} } \times \frac{1 \, \text{hr} }{3600 \, \text{} }\)</li>
        <li>Calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the truck:
        \(KE = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2\)
        where m is the weight of the truck in lb.</li>
        <li>Calculate the thermal energy (Q) absorbed by all brakes:
        \(Q = KE\)</li>
        <li>Calculate the thermal energy per brake drum (\(Q_{\text{per brake} }\)):
        \(Q_{\text{per brake} } = \frac{Q}{n_{\text{tires} } }\)</li>
        <li>Calculate the temperature increase (\(\Delta T\)) for each brake drum:
        \(\Delta T = \frac{Q_{\text{per brake} } } {m c}\)</li>
        <li>Add the temperature increase to the initial temperature (assumed to be the ambient temperature) to find the final temperature (\(T_f\)):
        \(T_f = T_i + \Delta T\)</li>
    </ol>
    The calculated temperature increase for each brake drum is approximately {correct_answers.tempIncrease}°F.
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>Explanation and Clarification: The calculations are based on the conservation of energy principle, where the kinetic energy of the truck is entirely converted into thermal energy in the brakes. The specific heat capacity of the brake material is used to determine how much the temperature of the brakes will increase as they absorb this energy. It is important to convert all units to a consistent system (e.g., feet, seconds, pounds, BTUs) for accurate calculations.</p><h2> Level 5 </h2><p>Educational Goal: The guide aims to help understand the principles of energy conservation and heat transfer in a real-world context. By following the methodical steps, one can learn how to apply these principles to calculate temperature changes due to energy conversion processes.</p><h2> Level 6 </h2><p>Solution: \( \Delta T  = \frac{M~V^2}{778.169*2*n*m*c} \) 778.169 converts ft-lb to BTU. n = # of tires</p></html>
