        <ul>
            Reaction forces acting on EG:
            <li>Point G: There is a weight force acting on G pointing down. </li>
            <li>Point F: There is a reaction force on point F pointing towards point A.</li>
            <li>Point E: There is a reaction force on point E point towards pin D.</li>
            <li>From here you can try and solve for the raction at point E</li>
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        <ul>
            Solving for the reaction force on point E:
            <li> \( \Sigma M_F = 0, \implies \) Sin(\( \phi \))(\( E_r \))(\( L_4 \)) - Sin(\( \theta \))(W)(\( L_1 \)) = 0, \( \implies E_r  \)= Sin(\( \theta \))(W)(\( L_1 \)) / Sin(\( \phi \))(\( L_4 \)) = \( 10291.267589285722 \) \( N \) </li>
            <li>Where \( \theta \) = \( 45 \) (deg) and \( \phi \) = atan(\( L_3/L_4 \)), which is the anlgle between \( E_r \) and the beam EG. </li>
            <li>Now try solving for reaction at pin D now that you have the reaction force \( E_r \).</li>
        </ul>
