        <ul>
            <li> To convert the distributed force in green into a concentrated force you must take the intagrel of the function w(x).</li>
            <li> To convert the other 3 distributed forces to 3 concentrated forces you must compute the areas of the shapes by using the given lengths and the (distributed force per unit length) as the heights. </li>
            <li> To compute the centroid of the distributed force in green we must simply take the integral of (x)(w(x)) divided by the force or the integral of w(x).</li>
            <li> To compute the centroids of the other 3 shapes we must know the following information: centroid of a quarter circle = (4)(r)/(3\( \pi \)), Triangle = 1/3(Base) , Square= (Base)/2 </li>
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        <ul>
        <li> Green distributed load into a concentrated force: \( F_G \) = integral from 0 to \( 19 \) of w(x) = \( ((0.229)(11.67)^3)/3. \) </li>
        <li> Red distributed load into concentrated force: \( F_R \) = \( \pi(w(19)^2)/4 \). </li>
        <li> Purple distributed load into a concentrated force: \( F_P \) = \(  (23.27)(19)/2 \) </li>
        <li> Orange distributed load into a concentrated force: \( F_O \) = \( (23.27)(19) \)</li>

        <li> Green centroid position: \( G_x \) = integral from 0 to \( 19 \) of w(x)(x) devided by the \( F_G \) = \( ((0.229)(11.67)^4/4) / ((0.229)(11.67)^3/3) = (3/4)(19) \)</li>
        <li> Red centroid position: \( R_x = (4)(2)(5.83)/3\pi \)</li>
        <li> Purple centroid position: \( P_x = (1/3)(19) \)</li>
        <li> Orange centroid position: \( O_x = 5.83/2 \)</li>
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>
    <ul>
    <pl> Now that we have all 4 of the concentrated forces and there centroid positions, we can now take the moment about point A to solve for reaction force at point B (\( B_y \)).</pl>
    <pl>\(  \Sigma M_A = 0 \implies B_y(L_1+L_2) + F_G(L_3+L_2-G_x) + F_R(L_3-R_x) - F_P(L_3+L_1-P_x) - F_O(L_1+L_3+L_3-O_x) = 0 . \)</pl>
    <pl> Now you can solve for \( B_y \) to obtain a solution of \( B_y = 181.8259253435164\ lb \)<pl>
