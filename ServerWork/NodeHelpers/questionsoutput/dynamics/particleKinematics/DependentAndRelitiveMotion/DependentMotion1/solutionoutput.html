      </head><h2> Level 0 </h2><p>The first step is to identify that there are two ropes in this system. We can describe the motion of the two ropes separately. </p><h2> Level 1 </h2><p>
   
Rope 1:Rope one can be the rope connecting point A and the small pulley.
<p>Equation of motion can be written as, \( L_1 = s_2+s_2 \) \( \implies \) \(  0  = v_2 + v_2 \) \( \implies \) \( v_2 = -v_2 \) \( \implies \) \( v_2 =-v_o \) </p>
Here \( L_1 \) is the length of the rope, and \( s_2 \) is the distance from our datum to the edge of the rope. In this problem, our datum is located in the center of the top pulley.
<p>\(  \)</p>
<p>Rope 2: Rope two can connect block B and the ceiling.</p>
Equation of motion for rope 2 can be written as \( L_2 = s_1 + 2(s_1-s_2) \) \( \implies \) \( 0 = v_1+2v_1-2v_2 \) \( \implies \) \( v_1 = \frac{2}{3}v_2 \)
<p>Here \( L_2 \) is the length of rope two, and \( s_1 \) is the distance from the datum to the center of the very bottom pulley.</p>


    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        <ul>
       We can finally solve the velocity of block B by connecting equation 1 with equation 2.
       <p>Connecting the equations we get: \( v_1  =-\frac{2}{3}v_0 \)</p>
       Here \( v_1 \) is the rate at which the length \( s_1 \) changes. And because \( s_1 \) is the length at which the bottom pulley is moving upwards it can resemble the motion of block B.
       <p>Solution: speed of block B is   \( v_B  =-\frac{2}{3}v_0 \) \( \implies \) \( 5.333333333333333 \) m/s</p>


      </ul>
