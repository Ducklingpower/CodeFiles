There will be a moment reaction about point B and the distributed load pointing down on the beam.  
       Before we are able to solve it, we have to figure out what the concentrated force is and where it is located.
    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        <ul>
           Converting distributed load into one concentrated force:
           We can model this distributed load as a linear function. Using y=mx+b we can write our function as y=\( \frac{-F_d}{L_1+2L_1} \)x+\( F_d \).
           Using our function we can find the magnitude of the distributed load at point B. \( F_{dB} \) = \( \frac{-F_d}{L_1+2L_1}(L_1)+F_d \).
           Now we can find the concentrated force of the distributed load that goes from B to C. We can do this by calculating the area under the linear line.
           The area under the Line is equal to \( \frac {F_{dB}(2L_1)}{2} \). Lastly, we can compute the location of the concentrated force to be 1/3 the base.




           <li>Concentrated force = F = \( \frac{F_{dB}(2L_1)}{2} \)</li>
           <li>Location of force = xx = \( \frac{2L_1}{3} \)</li>




           Now that we know the concentrated force we can compute the internal forces acting on point B








       
        </ul>

        Computing internal forces at point B using static equations
        <p>Using the free body diagram:</p>
        <li>\( \Sigma{F}_x = 0 ~\implies~ -N = 0 \)</li>
        <li>N=0</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>\( \Sigma{F}_y = 0 ~\implies~ -F+V=0 \)</li>
        <li>V = F = \( 188~ N \)</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>\( \Sigma{M}_B = 0 ~\implies~ M_B-F(xx) \)</li>
        <li>\( M_B = F(xx) = 376 ~N m \)</li>
        </ul>
