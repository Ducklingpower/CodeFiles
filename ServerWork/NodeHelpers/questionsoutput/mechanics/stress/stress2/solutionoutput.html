So we can compute the area under the curve as F = \( \frac{F_d(L_1)}{2} \).
        We can also find the location under the curve as xx = \( \frac{L_1}{3} \).
        <p>Now draw a free-body diagram of the beam to compute the tension force holding up the beam.</p>




    </p><h2> Level 2 </h2><p>
        <ul>
      FBD of beam:
      <p>There is an \( A_x \) and \( A_y \) reaction force both pointing in the positive direction at pin A. You can draw the concentrated force (F), xx distance away from point A.
        Lastly, there is a tension force pointing into the beam at an angle \( \theta \) off the beam on point B.




      </p>
       
      Using the free body diagram, try to compute the tension in the rod holding up the beam.








        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 3 </h2><p>
        <ul>
       Computing tension:
       <p>Using the free body diagram we can compute the moment about A.</p>
       <li>\( \Sigma{M}_A = 0 ~\implies F(\frac{L_1}{3})-Tsin(\theta)(L_1+L_2+L_2) = 0 \)</li>
       <li>Solving for T we get \( T = \frac{F(L_1)}{3sin(\theta)(L_1+L_2+L_2)} \)</li>




       Now that we have the tension we can draw a free body of the beam from point B to C to solve for the internal forces.
       
        </ul>
    </p><h2> Level 4 </h2><p>
        <ul>
       Drawing the free body diagram from point B to C we can draw the normal force pointing right starting from point C.
       There is a shear force pointing down and a moment at point C. Lastly we can't forget the tension force acting on point B at an angle \( \theta \).
           
       <p>Using the free body diagram we can compute internal force acting on point C using static equations.</p>
       <li>\( \Sigma{M}_C = 0 ~\implies M_C -Tsin(\theta)L_2=0 \)</li>
       <li>\( M_C = Tsin(\theta)L_2 = 95.53591954022987~ Nm \)</li>
       <p></p>
       <li>\( \Sigma{F}_x = 0 ~\implies N - Tcos(\theta)=0 \)</li>
       <li>\( N = Tcos(\theta) = 71.9448115615176 ~N \)</li>
       <p></p>
       <li>\( \Sigma{F}_y = 0 ~\implies V-Tsin(\theta)=0 \)</li>
       <li>\( V = Tsin(\theta) = 41.53735632183908~N \)</li>
