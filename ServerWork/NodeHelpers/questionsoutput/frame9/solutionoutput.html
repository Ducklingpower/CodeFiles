    <p>Solving for rection forces:  </p>
    By using our static equilibrium force equations we can solve for \( B_y \) and \( A_y \). Since there is no friction we know \( B_x \) and \( A_x \) = 0.
    <li>By doing \( \Sigma{M}_A = 0 \) \( \implies \) \( W(L_2+L_1+\frac{L_1}{2})-B_y(L_1+L_1+\frac{L_1}{2}) =0 \)</li>
    <li>Solving for \( B_y \) we get \( B_y = \frac{W(L_2+L_1+\frac{L_1}{2})}{L_1+L_1+\frac{L_1}{2}}  \)</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>By doing \( \Sigma{F}_y = 0 \) \( \implies \) \(  A_y + B_y -W =0  \)</li>
    <li>Solving for \( A_y \) we get \(  A_y = W-B_y \)</li>
     <p> Now that you have the reaction forces, the next step is to break the 3 members into there own components and draw free body diagrams on each of them. Using each members free body diagram you can start to solve for the rest of the points.</p>

                Using member CD to solve for \( C_y \) and \(  D_y \):
                <p></p>
                FBD of CD:   
                <li> On points C you can draw the reaction forces as up and right.On points D you can draw the reaction forces as down and right. Dont forget to draw the weight force pointing down \( L_2 \) distance away from C. </li>           
                <p></p>
                Solving:
                <li>By doing \( \Sigma{M}_D = 0 \) \( \implies \) \(  W(L_2+L_1) - C_y(L_1)=0  \)</li>
                <li>Solving for \( C_y \) we get \( C_y = \frac{W(L_2+L_1)}{L_1} \)</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>By doing \( \Sigma{F}_y = 0 \) \( \implies \) \(  C_y+D_y-W=0  \)</li>
                <li>Solving for \( D_y \) we get \( D_y =W-C_y \)</li>

                Now try and do the same method but instead with member CE this time.

                <p></p>
                <li>By doing \( \Sigma{M}_C = 0 \) \(  \implies \) \(  B_y(L_1)-E_y(xcos(\theta))-E_x(xsin(\theta)) = 0  \)</li>
                <li>Solving for \( E_x \) we get \( E_x = \frac{B_y(L_1)-E_y(xcos(\theta))}{xsin(\theta)} \)</li>
                    Where \( \theta \) is the angle ECD, and x is ther length from C to E. You can find these values by doing some trig and geometry.
                <p></p>
                Explanation:
                <li>Let angle A = angle CDE = \( tan^{-1}(\frac{2L_1}{\frac{L_1}{2}}) \)</li>

                <li>let angle C = angle DEC = 180 - (A+\( \theta \))</li>
                <li>Now let x = distance from C to E = \( \frac{L_1sin(A)}{sin(C)} \)</li>
