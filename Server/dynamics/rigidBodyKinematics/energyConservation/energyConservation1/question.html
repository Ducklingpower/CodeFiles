    <p>The thin rod of mass $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}}~  kg$ is held in the position shown. If the length of the rod is $\mathbf{L_1} = {{params.l1}} ~m$ and the length of the unsprung spring is $\mathbf{L_2} = {{params.l2}}~m$, determine the spring constant (k) if the rod is released from rest and drops down exactly 90$^o$. </p>
    <p>Note: assume the rod just makes it down 90 degrees. So at exactly 90 degrees, the rod is no longer moving.</p>
