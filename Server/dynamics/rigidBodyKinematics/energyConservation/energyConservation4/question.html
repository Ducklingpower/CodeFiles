<p>The green disk of mass $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}} ~kg$ and radius $\mathbf{r} = {{params.r}}~ m$ is initially at rest and is supported by the pin as shown, and can freely rotate. There is an external moment force acting on the disk of magnitude $\mathbf{M} = {{params.moment}} ~ Nm $. Determine the angle the disk would have to rotate in order to reach a speed of $\mathbf{\omega} = {{params.w}} ~rad/s$. </p>
<p>The spring with a stiffness of $\mathbf{k} ={{params.k}} ~N/m$ is attached to the disk at all times and is able to rap around the disk. </p>
