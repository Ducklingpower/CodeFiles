<p>The double pulley has two wheels that are attached to each other making 1 pulley with radius $\mathbf{r_1} = {{params.r1}}~m$ and radius $\mathbf{r_2} = {{params.r2}}~m$. The pulley has a mass $\mathbf{m_p} = {{params.mp}}$ and a radius of gyration of $\mathbf{k} = {{params.k}}~m$.</p>
<p>The pulley supports a rope that is holding block A of mass $\mathbf{m_A} = {{params.ma}}~kg $ and is being pulled by the force $\mathbf{F} = {{params.f}} ~N$. </p>
<p>Determine the speed of the lock after {{params.t}} seconds if the block starts from rest.</p>
