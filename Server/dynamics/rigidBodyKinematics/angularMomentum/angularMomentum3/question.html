<p>A surface with mass $\mathbf{m_s} = {{params.ms}}~kg$ is subjected to the force $\mathbf{F} = {{params.f}}~N$. The wheel of radius $\mathbf{r} = {{params.r}}~m$ has a mass $\mathbf{m_w} ={{params.mw}}~kg$ and a radius of gyration of $\mathbf{k} = {{params.k}}~m$ rotates on the fixed pin as the surface is being pulled.</p>
<p>Assume there is no slip between the surface and the wheel. If the desired angular velocity is ${{params.w}} ~rad/s$, determine the time it will take to obtain this angular velocity if the wheel starts from rest.</p>
