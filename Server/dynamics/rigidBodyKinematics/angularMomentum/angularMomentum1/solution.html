    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">This problem is broken down into two steps. The conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy. It's important to identify the states you want to analyze and apply these conservation equals to.</pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
 
        <ul>
           <p>Applying conservation of angular moment:
            <li>State 1: The moment just before the wheel makes contact with the bump.</li>
            <li>State 2: The moment the wheel is rotating over the bump.</li>
           </p>
           <p>conservation of angular Moment: $H_1 = H_2$</p>
           <li>$r(mv_1) + I \omega_1 = r' (mv_2) + I \omega_2$</li>
           <li>Here : r' = (r-H). This is because when the wheel is rotating on the bump to get over it, its rotating about the height of the bum and no longer at the base of the wheel.</li>
           <p>If substitute $\omega _2 = \frac{v_2}{r}$ since there is no slipping we get: </p>
           <li>$r(mv_1) + I \omega_1 = r' (mv_2) + I (\frac{v_2}{r})$</li>
           <p>In this equation we have 2 unknowns. $v_1$ and $v_2$, We can use conservation of energy to obtain another equation to solve for the unknowns.</p>
           <p>Solving for $v_2$:</p>
           <li>$v_2 = v_1 (\frac{r m +frac{I}{r} }{(m r' + \frac{I}{r})})$</li>
        </ul>

    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <ul>
           <p>Applying conservation of energy to state 1 and state 3:
        <li>State 1: we said it was, The moment just before the wheel makes contact with the bump. </li>
        <li>State 3: This is the moment the wheel just makes it over the entire bump with zero velocity.</li>
           </p>
<p>Conservation of energy says:</p>
<li>$PE_1 + KE_1 + U_{1-3} = PE_3 + KE_3$</li>
<li>$0 + (\frac{1}{2} mv_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} I \omega_1^2 )+ 0 = mgH + 0$</li>
<p>If substitute $\omega_1 = \frac{v_1}{r}$ since there is no slipping we get: </p>
<li>$0 + (\frac{1}{2} mv_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} I (\frac{v_1}{r})^2 )+ 0 = mgH + 0$</li>
<p>Solving for $v_1$ we get:</p>
<li>$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{mgH}{\frac{1}{2} (m + \frac{I}{r^2})} }$</li>

        </ul>
    </pl-hint>




    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        <ul>
            <p>solve for $v_2$. This is the velocity we need to find as it is the velocity that allows the wheel to rotate over the hill.</p>


            <p>Plugging in $v_1$ into : $v_2 = v_1 (\frac{r m +\frac{I}{r} }{(m r' + \frac{I}{r})})$ , We get;</p>
            <li>$v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{mgH}{\frac{1}{2} (m + \frac{I}{r^2})} } (\frac{r m +\frac{I}{r} }{(m r' + \frac{I}{r})})$ = {{correct_answers.v}} $m/s$</li>
