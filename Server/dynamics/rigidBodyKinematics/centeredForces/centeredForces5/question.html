<p>The race-car has a mass of $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}}~kg$ and center of mass as shown, $\mathbf{L_f} = {{params.lf}} ~m$, $\mathbf{L_r} = {{params.lr}} ~m$, and $\mathbf{h} = {{params.h}} ~m$</p>
<p>Determine the maximum acceleration the car can have so that the tires slip. The car is rear-wheel drive, with both rear tires supplying tractive force. Coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mathbf{\mu} = {{params.mu}}$.</p>
<p>You may neglect the mass of the tires.</p>
