    <p>The unbalanced flywheel has a mass of $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}}~kg$ and a radius of gyration about the pin connection of $\mathbf{k} = {{params.k}}~m$.</p>
    <p>If the center of mass is off-centered by the length $\mathbf{L} = {{params.l}}~m$, determine the magnitude of the reaction forces at the pin joint and the angular acceleration of the flywheel at the instant it is released from rest.</p>
