  <p>The wheel of mass $\mathbf{m} = {{params.m}} ~kg$ is held up by the pin joint rod. There's some string wrapped around the wheel and the string is unraveled by the force $\mathbf{F} = {{params.f}} ~ N$.</p>
  <p>The coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mathbf{\mu _k} = {{params.mu}}$ and the radius of the wheel is ${{params.r}} ~m$. Determine the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the wheel if the radius of gyration about the center axis is $\mathbf{k} = {{params.k}}~ m$  </p>
  <p>Let the length be $\mathbf{L} = {{params.l}}$.</p>
