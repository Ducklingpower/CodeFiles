    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">The first step is to draw a free-body diagram and identify the motion of the center of mass. </pl-hint>
   




    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
       
        <p>Identifying the motion of the center of mass:</p>
        <li>Since the plate is fixed to the pin at A, the place is only allowed to rotate in a circular motion about pin A.</li>
        <li> We can say that there will be acceleration in both the x and y directions in order to meet the circular motion requirement.</li>
        <li>So there will be a force in both the x and y direction since the plate has a mass.</li>


        <p>free body diagram:</p>
        <li>$\Sigma{F_x} = ma ~\implies~ A_x = m a_x$</li>
        <li>$\Sigma{F_y} = ma ~\implies~ A_y - w = m a_y$</li>
        <li>$\Sigma{M_a} = I \alpha ~\implies~ w(r~cos(45)) = I \alpha$ </li>
        <p>r = $\sqrt{(\frac{L}{2})^2 + (\frac{L}{2})^2}$ this is just the vector from point A to the center of mass (center of the plate).</p>
        <p>I = $\frac{m}{12}(L^2+L^2) + mr^2$ . We have to add the ($mr^2$) to the moment of inertia of a square plate since we are taking a moment about point A and not the center of mass.</p>


        <p>Now you can solve.</p>
    </pl-hint>




    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <ul>
    <p>Solving for $\alpha $ we get:</p>
    <li> $\alpha = \frac{w~rcos(45)}{I} = {{params.a}} rad/s^2$</li>
    <p>Now that we have $\alpha$ we can find the acceleration in both the x and y directions. </p>
    <li>$a_x = \alpha r*cos(45)$</li>
    <li>$a_y = \alpha r*sin(45)$</li>


    <p>we can substitute $a_x$ and $a_y$ in our force equartions:</p>
    <li>$A_x = m a_x ~ \implies~ A_x = m \alpha r*cos(45)$ = {{correct_answers.Ax}} N</li>
    <li>$A_y = w - m a_y ~ \implies~ A_y =w - m \alpha r*sin(45)$ = {{correct_answers.Ay}} N</li>


   
        </ul>
    </pl-hint>
