    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">The first step is to identify that there are two ropes in this system. We can describe the motion of the two ropes separately. </pl-hint>



    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
   
Rope 1:Rope one can be the rope connecting point A and the small pulley.
<p>Equation of motion can be written as, $L_1 = s_2+s_2$ $\implies$ $ 0  = v_2 + v_2$ $\implies$ $v_2 = -v_2$ $\implies$ $v_2 =-v_o$ </p>
Here $L_1$ is the length of the rope, and $s_2$ is the distance from our datum to the edge of the rope. In this problem, our datum is located in the center of the top pulley.
<p>$$</p>
<p>Rope 2: Rope two can connect block B and the ceiling.</p>
Equation of motion for rope 2 can be written as $L_2 = s_1 + 2(s_1-s_2)$ $\implies$ $0 = v_1+2v_1-2v_2$ $\implies$ $v_1 = \frac{2}{3}v_2$
<p>Here $L_2$ is the length of rope two, and $s_1$ is the distance from the datum to the center of the very bottom pulley.</p>

        <ul>
       We can finally solve the velocity of block B by connecting equation 1 with equation 2.
       <p>Connecting the equations we get: $v_1  =-\frac{2}{3}v_0$</p>
       Here $v_1$ is the rate at which the length $s_1$ changes. And because $s_1$ is the length at which the bottom pulley is moving upwards it can resemble the motion of block B.
       <p>Solution: speed of block B is   $v_B  =-\frac{2}{3}v_0$ $\implies$ ${{correct_answers.vb}}$ {{params.unitsSpeed}}</p>
