    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">To determine the weight of the truck, we first need to calculate the energy absorbed by the brakes during the braking process.</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">The energy absorbed by each brake can be calculated using the formula: $E = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the brake ({{params.weight}} kg), $c$ is the specific heat of the brake material ({{params.specificHeat}} J/(kg*C)), and \Delta T$ is the temperature increase ({{params.tempIncrease}} Celsius).</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">The total energy absorbed by all brakes can be found by multiplying the energy absorbed by one brake by the total number of brakes ({{params.numTires}}).</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">This energy comes from the kinetic energy of the truck, which can be expressed as: $KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m_{truck} \cdot v^2$, where $m_{truck}$ is the mass of the truck and $v$ is its velocity ({{params.speed}} km/h converted to m/s).</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">By equating the total energy absorbed by the brakes to the kinetic energy of the truck, we can solve for the mass (and thus the weight) of the truck. The calculated truck weight is {{correct_answers.truckWeight}} N (after converting mass to weight assuming Earth's gravity).</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="6" data-type="text">Remember to convert all units to a consistent system before performing calculations. For example, convert velocity from mph to ft/s, and convert the diameter of the brake drum to feet for mass calculations. In this case, velocity is converted from km/h to m/s, and the weight is calculated in Newtons.</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="7" data-type="text">After performing the calculations, the weight of the truck can be determined to be {{correct_answers.truckWeight}} N, which is the result of the dynamic calculation based on the provided parameters.</pl-hint>
