    <p>A rectangular block of plastic material is described as having the following dimensions: length $L = {{params.length}}$ mm, width $W = {{params.width}}$ mm, and height $H = {{params.height}}$ mm. Its lower face is glued to a bench, and a force of $F = {{params.force}}$ N is applied to the upper face, resulting in the upper face moving $\delta = {{params.displacement}}$ mm relative to the lower face.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine the shear stress on the upper face in {{params.unitsStress}}.</li>
        <li>Determine the shear strain on the upper face.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Assume the deformation is uniform.</p>
