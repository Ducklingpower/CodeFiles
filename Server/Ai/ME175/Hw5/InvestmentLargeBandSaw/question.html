    <p> Washington Mill Works is considering the purchase of a large resawing band saw for {{params.cost}} USD . The saw is expected to have a useful life of {{params.lifespan}} {{params.unitsYears}}, after which it will have an estimated salvage value of ${{params.salvageValue}} {{params.unitsCost}}. Each year, the annual income is estimated to be {{params.annualIncome}} {{params.unitsIncome}}, while the annual operating expenses are {{params.annualExpenses}} {{params.unitsExpenses}}. Assuming a minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) of {{params.MARR}}%:</p>
    <p> calculate the equivalent present worth of the cash flows over the seven-year period.</p>
    <p> calculate the equivalent annual worth of the cash flows over the seven-year period.</p>
    <p> calculate the equivalent future worth of the cash flows over the seven-year period.</p>
    <p> calculate the internal rate of return (IRR)</p>
