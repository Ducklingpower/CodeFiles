        To calculate the taxable income for ACME Inc., we start with the Before-Tax-and-Loan Cash Flow and deduct the payments made on loan principal, loan interest, and the MACRS depreciation deduction.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        The formula for taxable income can be expressed as:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = \text{Before-Tax-and-Loan Cash Flow} - \text{Loan Interest Payment} - \text{MACRS Depreciation Deduction}
        \]
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        Substituting the known values:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = {{params.before_tax_and_loan_cash_flow}} - {{params.loan_interest_payment}} - {{params.macrs_depreciation_deduction}}
        \]
    </pl-hint>
 
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        The final taxable income for ACME Inc. is thus calculated as follows:
        \[
        \text{Taxable Income} = {{params.before_tax_and_loan_cash_flow}} - {{params.loan_interest_payment}} - {{params.macrs_depreciation_deduction}} = {{correct_answers.taxable}}
        \]
    </pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">

        <p>The tax payed is the taxable income multiplied by the tax rate.</p>
        <p>Tax Payed = {{correct_answers.taxable}} $\times$ {{params.tax}}%= {{correct_answers.taxPayed}}</p>
       
    </pl-hint>

    
    <pl-hint level="6" data-type="text">

        The after tax cash flow (ATCF) can be found as: ATCF =  BTLCF - Tax Payed - Expenses

    <p>In our case the expenses is just the principle payed.</p>
    <p>AFTC = {{params.before_tax_and_loan_cash_flow}} - {{correct_answers.taxPayed}} - {{params.loan_principal_payment}} = {{correct_answers.ATCF}}</p>
