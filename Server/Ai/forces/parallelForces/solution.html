    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">Start by understanding the concept of resultant force and how it behaves when forces have the same or opposing directions.</pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">In this problem, the line of action for both forces is the same, which simplifies the calculation of their resultant.</pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <ul>
            For forces acting in the <strong>same direction</strong>:
            <li>The resultant force is simply the sum of the magnitudes of the two forces.</li>
            <li>Mathematically: $R = F_1 + F_2$, where $R$ is the resultant force.</li>
        </ul>
    </pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        When the forces act in the <strong>opposite directions</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>The resultant force is the absolute difference between the two forces.</li>
            <li>Mathematically: $R = |F_1 - F_2|$, where $R$ is the resultant force.</li>
        </ul>
        Note: Absolute value is used to ensure the resultant force has a non-negative magnitude.

        Ensure to interpret the results correctly:
        <ul>
            <li>A positive resultant in the same direction indicates that both forces are reinforcing each other.</li>
            <li>A resultant with zero magnitude, when subtracted, indicates the forces exactly cancel each other out.</li>
        </ul>
