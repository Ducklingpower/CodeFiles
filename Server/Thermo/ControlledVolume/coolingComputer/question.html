    <p>The electronic components of a computer are cooled by air flowing through a fan mounted at the inlet of the electronics enclosure. At steady state, air enters at $\mathbf{T_{in} } = {{params.T_in}}^\circ C$, $\mathbf{P_{in} } = {{params.P_in}}$ atm. For noise control, the velocity of the entering air cannot exceed $\mathbf{V_{max} } = {{params.V_max}}$ m/s. For temperature control, the temperature of the air at the exit cannot exceed $\mathbf{T_{out} } = {{params.T_out}}^\circ C$. The electronic components and fan receive, respectively, $\mathbf{P_{comp} } = {{params.P_comp}}$ W and $\mathbf{P_{fan} } = {{params.P_fan}}$ W of electric power.</p>

    <p>Determine the smallest fan inlet area, in $cm^2$, for which the limits on the entering air velocity and exit air temperature are met.</p>
