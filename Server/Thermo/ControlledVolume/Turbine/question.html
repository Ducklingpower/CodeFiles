    <p>Steam enters a turbine operating at steady state with a mass flow rate of $\mathbf{\dot{m} } = {{params.m_dot}}~ kg/h$. The turbine develops a power output of ${{params.Q_out}}$ kW. At the inlet, the pressure is 60 bar, the temperature is 400$^o$C , and the velocity is $\mathbf{v_1} = {{params.v1}}$ m/s. At the exit, the pressure is 0.1 bar, the quality is $\mathbf{x} = {{params.x}}$, and the velocity is $\mathbf{V_2} = {{params.v2}}$ m/s. Calculate the rate of heat transfer between the turbine and surroundings, in kW.</p>
