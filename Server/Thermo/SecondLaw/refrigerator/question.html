    <p>By steadily circulating a refrigerant at low temperature through passages in the walls of the freezer compartment, a refrigerator maintains the freezer compartment at $\mathbf{T_{L} } = {{params.T_L}}~^\circ C$ when the air surrounding the refrigerator is at $\mathbf{T_{H} } = {{params.T_H}}~^\circ C$. The rate of heat transfer from the freezer compartment to the refrigerant is $\mathbf{\dot{Q}_L} = {{params.Q_L}}~kJ/h$, and the power input required to operate the refrigerator is $\mathbf{W_{in} } = {{params.W_in}}~kJ/h$.</p>
    
    <p>Determine the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator and compare it with the coefficient of performance of a reversible refrigeration cycle operating between reservoirs at the same two temperatures.</p>
